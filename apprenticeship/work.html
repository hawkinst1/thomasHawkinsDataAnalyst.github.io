								<h2>Building a Data Analytic Service</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
				                	18th September 2023 I began the route into Data Analytics within Gateway Housing Association, under the tutelage of long term analyst who had come from the Government (NZ). 
							The task was to create a data analytics system that could replace/improve how internal and external data was handled, including:

                            <ul>

                                <li>General Data Protection Regulation</li>
                                <li>KPIs (internally)</li>

						 Coming into a business is very different to the tutorials that I used where they use a single datasheet and perform a basic SQL into Power BI combination.
						 Instead I need to determine where the data comes from which is being used to create the KPIs.
						 <br>
						 The data flow is something akin to: 						
					 </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Data is collected from the field</li>
						<li>Data is populated in a SQL based software</li>
						<li>Data is selected for KPIs by the relevant departnment leader</li>
						<li>Data is sent over and used in logic (i.e.; A/B*100%)</li>
						<li>Data gained from the logic is presented in Excel as a KPI</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The reality of real life though means turnover of staff, legacy practices etc., all of this goes into the current state of the entire 'Data Entity' of the business.</p>
					<hr>
					<h4 style="color:white">First Steps</h4>			
					<p>
						Dissecting the data means finding who gives it and how they manipulate it and what is needed amongst the vast amounts, finance, for example has a lot of data that will never be needed for the data team
						so getting the required KPI data is crucial. HR is under the protection of GDPR and so we can only have access to cleaned data from the HR team. The main bulk will be repairs and data relating to the compliance 
						of the social housing.

                                          An important aspect of TSA and forecasting, they serve to smooth out fluctuations and better reveal underlying trends in datasets.
                                          A Simple Moving Average (SMA) is the average of fixed points within a specified time window and equally wieghs all data points.
                                          A very simple way to reduce noise and identify trends, but is not able to respond to sudden changes in data.
                                          Weighted Moving Average (WMA) is similar to SMA but assigns different wieghts to the data points, which allows for emphasis on certain data points.
                                          Finally, Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) place greater wieght on the more recent data points and are able to quickly respond to changes.

                                            for data that can be grouped into categories to determine their ratio of the whole set.

                                            For viewing a 100% breakdown we will select Pie or Doughnut charts but it is also possible to view using stacked charts

                                          and Standard Deviation seems to crop up a lot so I will take a look at the use of it in statistics.

                                        <p>Standard deviation is used for understanding the variablilty of a dataset and determining outliers of it.
                                          The higher the sd, larger the spread of values around the mean and the higer the variance of the data can be said to be.

                                          The testing availble for nominal datasets includes testing hypotheses via non-parametric tests with the most common
                                          being: Chi-squared. This tests for a significant difference between an expected frequency and the actual frequency of
                                          distinct categories.
